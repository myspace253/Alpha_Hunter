# Solana AI Alpha Hunter 🚀

An AI-powered Solana token scanner that goes beyond "new token detected" alerts. It scores every
token with a weighted composite of on-chain, wallet, social, and narrative signals, flags rugpull /
honeypot risk, and pushes explainable alerts to Telegram.

> Status: **MVP scaffold**. Core pipeline (scan → score → risk → alert → Telegram) is fully wired
> and functional against real DexScreener/Birdeye/Helius APIs. Social signal collection, wallet
> reputation history, and the ML scoring models described in the roadmap are stubbed with clear
> `TODO`s — see [Roadmap](#roadmap) below.

## What it does

- Continuously scans Solana for new and re-heating tokens (new listings, whale accumulation,
  rising liquidity, viral social activity).
- Pulls signals from on-chain data (holders, LP, mint/freeze authority), DEX data (liquidity,
  volume, price action), wallet behavior (whale / smart-money buying), and social/narrative
  context.
- Runs everything through a transparent, weighted **AI Score** (0–100) plus a separate **Risk
  Score** (rugpull / honeypot / manipulation flags).
- Sends Telegram alerts with an explanation ("why is this token good?") instead of a bare number.
- Supports `/analysis`, `/risk`, `/hot`, `/new`, `/watch`, `/compare`, and more via Telegram
  commands.

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (or use the provided `docker-compose.yml`)
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- A [Helius](https://helius.dev) API key (free tier works for RPC calls)
- Optionally: a [Birdeye](https://birdeye.so) API key for holder counts + security checks

### 2. Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> alpha-hunter
cd alpha-hunter
npm install
```

### 3. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and fill in at minimum:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://alpha_hunter:change_me@localhost:5432/alpha_hunter
HELIUS_API_KEY=...
HELIUS_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=...
```

See `.env.example` for the full list of optional providers (Birdeye, Twitter, LunarCrush,
CryptoPanic, OpenAI) and alert thresholds (`MIN_ALERT_SCORE`, `MAX_ALERT_RISK`).

### 4. Start Postgres (and Redis)

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

Or point `DATABASE_URL` at an existing Postgres instance.

### 5. Run migrations

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This applies `src/services/db/schema.sql` — creates `token_analysis`, `wallet_reputation`,
`watchlist`, `alert_history`, and `backtest_results` tables.

### 6. Run the bot

```bash
npm run dev      # ts-node/tsx with auto-reload, for development
# or
npm run build && npm start   # compiled production run
```

On startup the bot verifies the DB connection, launches the Telegraf bot, schedules the recurring
scan job (`SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default 30s), and runs one scan cycle immediately.

### 7. Talk to your bot

In Telegram, message your bot and try:

```
/start
/help
/analysis <token_address>
/hot
/watch <token_address>
```

## Telegram commands (MVP set)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/start`, `/help` | intro + command list |
| `/new` | recently scanned tokens |
| `/hot` | highest AI-scored tokens right now |
| `/trending` | tokens with rising signals |
| `/analysis <address>` | full AI score + risk + explanation |
| `/risk <address>` | risk-only breakdown |
| `/whales <address>` | whale/smart-money wallet activity |
| `/wallet [address]` | a wallet's reputation profile, or top wallets by win rate if omitted |
| `/ask <question>` | free-form Q&A — the AI agent pulls live data to answer (also works via plain text, no command needed) |
| `/narrative <address>` | detected narrative tags |
| `/social <address>` | Twitter mentions, growth, and sentiment |
| `/compare <addr1> <addr2>` | side-by-side comparison |
| `/watch <address>` | add to personal watchlist |
| `/watchlist` | show your watchlist |
| `/settings` | view current alert thresholds |

## How the AI Score works

The composite `AI Score` (0-100) is a weighted blend, matching the original spec:

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Liquidity | 25% |
| Whale / smart-money activity | 20% |
| Volume | 15% |
| Social | 15% |
| Holder growth | 10% |
| Narrative | 10% |
| Developer activity | 5% |

Each sub-score is normalized 0-100 against a target threshold (e.g. $100k liquidity ≈ 100 points),
then combined. A separate **Risk Engine** independently flags mint/freeze authority status, LP
burn status, holder concentration, and volume-to-liquidity ratio (a wash-trading heuristic), and
discounts the final "bullish probability" accordingly. Every alert includes the plain-language
reasons behind both scores — see `scoringEngine.ts::explainScore()` and `riskEngine.ts`.

This rule-based engine is intentionally transparent and easy to audit for the MVP. It's designed
to be swapped out module-by-module for trained models (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost for scoring,
embeddings for narrative classification) without touching the rest of the pipeline — see below.

## Roadmap

This scaffold implements the **MVP** phase end-to-end. What's stubbed vs. real:

**Real / working now:**
- DexScreener integration (pairs, liquidity, volume, boosted/trending seed list)
- Birdeye integration (holder count, mint/freeze authority, top-holder concentration)
- Helius RPC client (largest accounts, supply, account info, webhook registration)
- Weighted AI scoring engine + rule-based risk engine
- PostgreSQL persistence + watchlist
- Telegram bot with the full MVP command set
- Scheduled scan → score → alert loop

**Also real now — Whale & Smart-Money Wallet Tracking:**
- `services/wallets/walletAnalyzer.ts` resolves the top holders of every scanned token
  (`getTokenLargestAccounts` → owner resolution via parsed account info), classifies each wallet
  (`whale`, `sniper`, `developer`, or a reputation-table label like `smart_money`), and checks
  Helius's enhanced-transactions API for recent buy/sell activity.
- Every observed buy/sell is written to a new `wallet_positions` table.
- `services/wallets/reputationUpdater.ts` runs hourly, matches buy→sell pairs FIFO per
  wallet+token, and recomputes each wallet's win rate, average hold time, and average profit —
  wallets with a ≥65% win rate over 3+ closed trades get auto-promoted to `smart_money`, feeding
  directly into the Whale Score (20% of the AI Score).
- `/whales <address>` and the new `/wallet [address]` Telegram command expose this — `/wallet`
  with no argument lists the current top wallets by win rate.
- Known limitation: wallet/token "age" and buy-timing (used for sniper detection) rely on
  `getSignaturesForAddress`, which only sees a rolling history window on public RPC nodes — good
  enough for recent launches, not archival-accurate for old wallets.

**Also real now — LLM-Based Narrative Classification:**
- `services/scoring/narrativeClassifier.ts` classifies each token's narrative (`Agent`, `Meme`,
  `DePIN`, `Gaming`, `RWA`, `DeFi`, `Consumer Crypto`, `Other`) with a real LLM call (OpenAI by
  default — see `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL` in `.env`), constrained to strict JSON output
  and validated against the allowed category list before use.
- Results are cached in a new `narrative_cache` table for 24h per token, so the scan loop doesn't
  re-classify the same token (and re-spend API credits) every cycle.
- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset, or the LLM call/parse fails for any reason, it automatically falls
  back to the original keyword matcher — narrative scoring never silently drops to zero.
- `services/scoring/narrativeTrends.ts` adds real **narrative momentum**: every 15 minutes it
  compares how often each category has shown up in scanned tokens over the last 24h vs. the prior
  24h and feeds that growth rate into the Narrative Score (up to +25 points for a narrative that's
  genuinely accelerating) — replacing the old hardcoded "hot narratives" list with the "Early
  Narrative Detection" behavior described in the original spec.
- `services/ai/llmClient.ts` is a small provider-agnostic wrapper (`LLM_PROVIDER=openai` today) —
  reuse it for the AI Assistant chat feature (`OPENAI_API_KEY` is already wired for that too).

**Also real now — Configurable AI Provider/Router (ZenMux-compatible):**
- The LLM calls in `narrativeClassifier.ts` and `aiAssistant.ts` no longer hit a hardcoded
  `api.openai.com` — the endpoint is built from `AI_BASE_URL` (default: OpenAI's own endpoint),
  so you can point the whole AI layer at a router/proxy like [ZenMux](https://zenmux.ai) without
  touching any code:
  ```
  AI_BASE_URL=https://zenmux.ai/api/v1
  API_TIMEOUT_MS=600000
  ```
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` is still sent as the bearer token — use your ZenMux (or other router) key
  there. `OPENAI_MODEL` selects which model the router forwards to.
- `API_TIMEOUT_MS` controls the request timeout for every LLM call (narrative classification,
  the `/ask` agent). Defaults to 10 minutes since routers/proxies to slower or queued models
  often need more headroom than a direct OpenAI call would.

**Also real now — Clickable Contract Links (Solscan / Birdeye / DexScreener):**
- Every message that shows a token — `/hot`, `/new`, `/trending`, `/analysis`, `/risk`,
  `/whales`, `/narrative`, `/social`, `/compare`, `/watch`, `/watchlist`, and auto-alerts — now
  includes the full contract address as tap-to-copy code, plus inline buttons that open the token
  directly on Solscan and Birdeye (DexScreener too, on single-token views).
- `services/telegram/formatters.ts::explorerLinks()` builds the three URLs from a bare address;
  `tokenActionKeyboard()` / `tokenListKeyboard()` build the Telegram inline keyboards. If you want
  to add another explorer (e.g. Solana Beach, Jupiter swap link), add it in one place there and
  it propagates to every command automatically.

**Also real now — AI Assistant Agent (free-form Q&A):**
- `services/ai/aiAssistant.ts` runs a bounded tool-calling agent loop against OpenAI: the model
  decides which of your live data sources it needs, calls them, reads the results, and answers
  in plain language — it never guesses numbers from memory.
- `services/ai/tools.ts` defines the tool set it can call: `analyze_token`, `get_wallet_reputation`,
  `get_top_wallets`, `get_top_tokens`, `get_narrative_momentum`, `get_watchlist`. Each maps
  directly to a function already built for the Telegram commands, so the agent and the slash
  commands stay in sync automatically.
- Capped at 4 tool-calling iterations per question to bound latency and API cost; falls back to
  a clear "not configured" message if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset, rather than failing silently.
- `get_watchlist`'s `chatId` is injected by the bot layer, not exposed as a model-controllable
  parameter — the agent can't be prompted into reading a different chat's watchlist.
- Wired into Telegram two ways: `/ask <question>` explicitly, and any plain-text message that
  isn't a recognized command falls through to the assistant automatically (e.g. paste an address
  and ask "is this safe?"). A Solana address found anywhere in the message is passed along as
  context even if the user doesn't explicitly say "token address: ...".

**Also real now — Social Signal Collection:**
- `services/social/lunarcrush.ts` pulls crypto-native social data (social volume, sentiment,
  Galaxy Score) via LunarCrush — the best source for sentiment specifically, though it mainly
  covers established/listed coins, not every fresh pump.fun mint.
- `services/social/twitterClient.ts` queries Twitter/X's recent tweet-counts endpoint for
  `$SYMBOL` cashtag mentions as a supplement/fallback (note: this endpoint requires at least
  Basic API access, not the free tier).
- `services/social/socialMonitor.ts` orchestrates both, and — like `narrativeTrends.ts` and the
  wallet reputation system — computes **real mention growth** by comparing the bot's own recorded
  history (last 24h vs. prior 24h in a new `social_snapshots` table) rather than trusting an
  external API's self-reported "24h change" field, which isn't consistently available across
  providers. `trending` only flips true once a token clears both a minimum mention floor and a
  growth threshold, filtering out noise from a handful of bot mentions.
- New `/social <address>` Telegram command and a matching `get_social_signals` AI Assistant tool
  surface this directly.
- Known limitation, by design: Telegram member growth (`telegramMemberGrowthPct`) is left unset.
  Tracking an arbitrary token's Telegram channel requires the bot to be a member/admin of that
  specific channel — not something that can be done generically for every token scanned. Wire it
  up per-community if that becomes a priority.

**Stubbed (clear `TODO` markers in code) — ready for Version 2/3 work:**
- `scoringEngine.ts::computeDeveloperScore()` — wire to GitHub API for AI-narrative tokens
- `riskEngine.ts::honeypotRisk` — needs a simulated sell-transaction check via RPC
- Backtesting engine — `backtest_results` table exists; needs a historical price replay job
- Web dashboard (Vue 3 + Tailwind, per the original spec) — not included in this backend-only
  scaffold

## Troubleshooting

**`429 Too Many Requests` from Helius or Birdeye**
Both clients now throttle requests to `HELIUS_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SEC` / `BIRDEYE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SEC`
(defaults: 2/sec and 1/sec) and automatically retry on 429 with backoff (honoring the provider's
`Retry-After` header when present). If you're still seeing persistent 429s:
- Lower the relevant `*_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SEC` value in `.env` to match your actual plan limit —
  check the `X-RateLimit-Limit` response header Birdeye/Helius send back, or your account
  dashboard, rather than guessing.
- Increase `SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` so fewer tokens get analyzed per minute.
- Upgrade your Helius/Birdeye plan if you're running this against a real token volume — the free
  tiers are meant for light testing, not a 24/7 scanner.
- Helius wallet buy/sell checks (`getEnhancedTransactions`) are cached for 3 minutes per wallet,
  so repeated scan cycles within that window reuse the same fetch instead of re-hitting the API.

**`402 Payment Required` from your LLM provider (e.g. ZenMux)**
This is not a bug — it's the provider declining the request, not a rate limit or code error.
ZenMux specifically returns this for some "free" models as an anti-abuse measure: the model is
only usable once the account holds *some* balance, even though using it doesn't cost anything.
Fix by either topping up a small balance on the provider account, or switching `OPENAI_MODEL` to
a model that doesn't have that restriction. The bot already degrades gracefully when this
happens — narrative classification falls back to the keyword matcher, and `/ask` returns a
"couldn't reach the AI assistant" message instead of crashing.

## Disclaimer

This tool surfaces signals for research purposes only — it is not financial advice. On-chain
scoring heuristics can be wrong, and low-cap Solana tokens carry very high risk including total
loss of funds. Always do your own research before trading.
